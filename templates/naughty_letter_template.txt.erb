Dear <%= name.capitalize %>,

You must be very excited that Christmas is coming. Are you looking forward to getting lots of fun toys?

Are you? Seriously? C'mon kid.

I've been watching you all year. Mostly by hacking into the camera of your Smart Home Monitoring system (your Mom really should put a password on that). And you've been a very naughty <%= gender %>.

I can forgive a lot but when you <%= infraction %> it was the last straw. If it were up to me, you'd get nothing. In fact, I'd take back that Furby I got you last year. But Mrs. Claus insisted that I bring you something on your list.
<% if toys.include?('Kaleidoscope') %>
Unfortunately, Merton messed up the Kaleidoscope order and the shipment won’t arrive until January. We’re substituting your Kaleidoscope, with a picture of a whale.
<% else %>
So you're getting the <%= toy %>. But I'm making sure it's from the defect pile.
<% end %>

As for the <%= naughty_toys %>: Better luck next year.

Remember – I'll be watching you.

Regards,
Santa "All-seeing" Claus
